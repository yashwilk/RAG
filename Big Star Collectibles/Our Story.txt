Our story began at the International Arts Conference in 2013. Our founder, Saura Chen, a trained photographer, captured a series of candid images and portraits of the keynote speaker and presenters at the event, and provided print copies of the photographs to attendees at the end of the day. When she overheard a group of attendees attempting to secure autographs from the presenters and negotiating photo trades, the seeds for Big Star Collectibles were planted. 

Launched officially in 2014, Saura was determined to create high-quality trading cards that were desirable and valuable for the collecting community. Besides monthly releases for the casual collector, Big Star Collectibles also releases limited editions and one-of-a-kind items. 

Big Star Collectibles has grown over the years to include memorabilia, contests, events, appraisals, and consultation services.
