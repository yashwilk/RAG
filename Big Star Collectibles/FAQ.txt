What are Big Star Collectibles products printed on?
Our cards, high-quality photo prints, and other printed products are all reproduced on eco-friendly papers and fabrics. All of our products are water repellent (yes, even the paper-based products!) using our sustainable patent-pending coating system, guaranteeing long-term quality, collectability, and wearability.

How can I find out how much my Big Star Collectibles product is worth? 
There are a few ways to find out what your collectible is worth:
Hire a Big Star Collectibles expert to conduct a formal appraisal. Depending on your needs, this can be a simple retail estimate, or a detailed analysis of its insurance replacement value, or a collectible’s projected value over a determined time frame.
Keep up with overall value trends on our website and newsletters.
Post about it in our online user’s forum. While this isn’t a precise measure of worth, it may give you an idea of its desirability among your peers.

How can I be the first to know about new products?
Become a Big Star Collectibles insider! It’s easy: sign up for our monthly newsletters and official announcements about new collectibles and more.            

Why don’t you have more for sale?
From the start, Big Star Collectibles has been about quality rather than quantity. We strive to give our customers the absolute best of the best, and we also acknowledge that creating limited editions enhances and adds to the value of each product, now and in the future.
 
Where do you ship, and how much does it cost?
We ship worldwide, and costs vary. When you check out and enter your shipping information, shipping choices and their respective costs will automatically calculate. If there is more than one option, it will ask you to pick the one you want to use.

Return policy

Limited Edition Collectibles: ALL SALES ARE FINAL with few exceptions.
We take great care to package every item you purchase to make sure it gets to you in mint shape. On the very, very rare instance that your product is damaged on its way to you, we usually will accept returns or exchanges. If the wrong item was shipped, we will exchange it at no cost to you. Please note that we cannot guarantee exact exchanges or replacements due to the limited runs of certain collectibles and memorabilia, and the high volume of potential buyers we typically have for each product. Contact Customer Service immediately upon discovering the issue to discuss next steps. 

Clothing: Except for collectible, one-of-a-kind clothing (such as a signed hat or apron), we accept returns and/or exchanges for clothing that is in original, unworn, and unwashed condition. If you have any questions about sizing, please contact Customer Service or view our Sizing Chart.
